# **Introduction about myself**

## My name is sara altayeh

## I'm 24 years old

## the first paragraph:

>I graduated from the University of Jordan two years ago and started working for a year in the sales position, but I did not see myself in that place, so in that time i started to hear about front end development and how the all world and The future is heading towards a technology world.
>
>In that moment i started to search and read alot about programming espically about fornt-end development and this website [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) was the first website i started learning from.
Since then I have always been trying to improve myself until reach to great Scholarship from LTUC.

## the second paragraph:
* It was a great article and useful to read and there is some of important points i learned from it:

1. Every programmer is a designer, so the design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
2. the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
3. A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.
4. Think before acting, so Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else.
5. the main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
6. All changes require maintenance.
7. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help => always search, try to find answers then ask.
8. Don’t be a hero.
9. Be open-minded. Don’t be obsessive about one technology. Use the required technology to solve a specific problem.
10. Everything takes longer than you think.

***It is really full of valuable information, I recommend everyone to read it***
